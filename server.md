Exchange a defect harddisk

Exchange the defect disk
When you find out that a disk is defect, you should change it with a new one.
After you changed it you must also replace the defect disk-id with the new disk-id in the zpool:
you see the defect harddisk with the command:
zpool status
if there is a disk with the state UNAVAILABLE, that should be exchanged with a new disk
to replace the defect disk-id you need this command:
zpool replace tank [defect-disk-id] [new-disk-id]
to see that its really replaced type in again:
zpool status
if you see that the zpool is resilvering, then you are done.
NOTE: resilvering can take long time, thats normal.
Send the defect disk to the manufacturer
go to website: https://westerndigital.secure.force.com/ind/ID_Login
register the disks with their ID
create a RMA with the defect disks
click on "View RMA Premailer"
click on print, print it out and put it in and on the packet
bring the packet to the mail
