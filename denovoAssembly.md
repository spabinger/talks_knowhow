CLC
===

* in-house algorithm
* short & long reads
* mixing of paired reads (variable insert size & orientation
* quality trimming!
* hybrid data (454 & Illumina)
* the more data the bigger the k-mer size
* they say 'optimal parameter selection sometimes requires experimentation'
* -g option --> use certain reads only in later stages (gap closing, bubble resolving, scaffolding)



XworX assembly
==============
* Comparison of assemblies from different tools at the end

* ?? Downsampling of input data -> use max coverage


* TODO - test with gage data
* TODO - testing framework
